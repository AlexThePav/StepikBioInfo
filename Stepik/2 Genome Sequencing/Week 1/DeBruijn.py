# Input: An integer k and a string Text.
# Output: DeBruijnk(Text), in the form of an adjacency list.

### Hints ###
# The two instances of "AGA" in the sample output does not simply mean that
# "AGA" appears twice: it means that "AGA" appears twice directly after "AAG"
# (i.e., there are two instances of "AAGA"). Regarding AAG, it only appears
# once as a k-mer suffix (TAAG), meaning it should only appear on the right
# side once: to the right of TAA. Regarding TCT, it appears as a suffix
# twice: TTCT and CTCT, so it shows up once to the right of TTC and once
# to the right of CTC

# Basically, for every k-mer in Text, we're creating an edge
# "Prefix(k-mer) -> Suffix(k-mer)".
# For example, if the string is CTCTA and k = 3, then:
# CTCTA: CTC becomes CT -> TC
# CTCTA: TCT becomes TC -> CT
# CTCTAï»¿: CTA becomes CT -> TA
# The final output would be:
# CT -> TC,TA
# TC -> CT
